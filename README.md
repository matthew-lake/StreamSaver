Software to save video from UQ Library Video on Demand.

### Legal Concerns

Firstly, to use this software requires access to UQ Library site, which makes use possible only for current UQ staff and students, for whose benefit the content is made available. Furthermore, according to http://www.uq.edu.au/terms-of-use/ (accessed 14-09-2015): "For personal, non-commercial purposes, you may view or make copies of the material contained on the site." This is simply software designed to help the user make copies. It is believed that the clause "Content may not be systematically downloaded, retrieved or stored." does not apply to this application, since it does not offer systematic downloads. It is interpretted that this clause makes a distinction between manual downloading of content by a user and automatic or batch downloading of content triggered by software. In such a case, this app is clearly in the former camp, as it does not offer support for automatic or batch downloading - rather downloads must be triggered by a user after they have (seperately) signed into the UQ Library site, selected the content they wish to download, and copied the URL.

If you believe that is is incorrect and/or that this app breaches UQ's Terms of Service, please email me at me@mgtlake.com
